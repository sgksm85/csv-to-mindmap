### Getting started

Install the package as a dependency on your own project by running:

```
npm install mirotone
// or with yarn
yarn add mirotone
```

For using something like [PostCSS import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import) you can do the following:

```css
@import 'mirotone/dist/styles.css';
```

You can also use standard CSS linking to use the styles right away in your project:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/mirotone/dist/styles.css" />
```

## Browser support

Mirotone heavily relies on [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties). This means that it is not supported in IE11 and below. All other modern browsers are supported.
