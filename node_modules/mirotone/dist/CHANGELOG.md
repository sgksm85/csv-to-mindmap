#### DEPRECATED

- Added all icons as SVG to the package to make it easier to include the icons into your projects HTML directly.
- All icons SVG files don't have a `fill` property anymore. Coloring is now done via css filters so we can change them on hover
- Added the option to add icons to buttons
- Added Tertiary button style
  - _IMPORTANT_ `.button-icon`, `.button-secondary-border` and `.button-danger-border` are going to be deprecated in a later version. They are already removed form docs to prevent further usage. Please start migrating to normal buttons with backgrounds.
- Harmonized active/focus states across Links/buttons and inputs
- Added the option to add a button inside a tag

  - `.icon-text-strikethrough-BUI` became `.icon-text-strikethrough-bui`
  - `.icon-text-underline-BUI` became `.icon-text-underline-bui`
- Removed `.icon-add-collumn-right`, use the correct classname: `.icon-add-column-right`.
